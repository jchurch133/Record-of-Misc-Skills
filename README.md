# Record-of-Misc-Skills

I wanted a place where I could list skills I have explored but haven't implemented in a project yet. This includes experience with Github, VSCode, Kubuntu, and some SQL.

My first document practices beginner SQL commands including: CREATE, USE, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, ALTER, ADD, REMOVE, SELECT, DROP, WHERE, DISTINCT, LIKE, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, DELETE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NULL, DESC, AS, OR, AND, INT, VARCHAR.
