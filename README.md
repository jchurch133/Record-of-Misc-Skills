I wanted a place where I could list skills I have practiced that haven't been represented in other projects even though they may not produce any particular products.

My first document practices beginner SQL commands including: CREATE, USE, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, ALTER, ADD, REMOVE, SELECT, DROP, WHERE, DISTINCT, LIKE, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, DELETE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NULL, DESC, AS, OR, AND, INT, VARCHAR.
